Kickstartcoding Front-end HW1

For this project, I will attempt to illustrate a few famous fast food stock market share prices via Bar Graph! 

I will be using and API provided by https://financialmodelingprep.com/ to get my values that change in realtime (...whoa).

Currently, the bars in the graph are static. In our next project, we will utilize more advanced JavaScript code to adjust the values through the API.
